Summary
Given some UI design mock-ups and a set of API endpoints, you are expected to build a mini web front-end application from the mock-ups, and integrate the API endpoints accordingly.
The objective is to assess your HTML, JS, and CSS skills; creativity; problem solving approach; code structure and “cleanliness”; and general problem interpretation.
The Design Mock-ups
You can find the UI mock-ups at this link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/07678de3-f5c3-4ddb-4f34-375d0d8b8a8b-7156/​. The mock-ups can be viewed in presentation mode where you can click on some elements interactively; or in design specs mode where you can click on the design elements and export the required icons and colors.
You can take time out to go through the mock-ups first and reach out if you need any help with anything, or have any questions.
The API
The API endpoints you will be working with are documented here:
https://swapi.dev/documentation
The Task
Build the web front-end for the UI mock-ups provided, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and/or a JS Front-end framework of your choice (​React​ will be a plus). Hook up the data from the APIs in the appropriate places on the front-end as depicted by the UI mock-ups.
Things to Note
● Build the layout to match the design mock-up as best as possible.
● The login page should be the first page viewed
● The login page has no APIs to be implemented, i.e. on click of “Sign In” you can
simply display the dashboard. But note the following requirements for the login page:
○ The email and password fields are required
○ The email must be a valid email address
○ The password must be a combination of letters and numbers, and must be at
least 8 characters
  
○ The Sign In button should be disabled until the email and password fields pass validation.
● Any detail from the mock-up that has no representation from the API, you can simply display the detail as it is
● You are free to add your own bit of creativity to a reasonable extent, but it’s advisable to not do so to the detriment of the time you have to complete the task.
